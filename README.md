# 📚 Online Learning Management System (LMS)

A frontend-based Learning Management System (LMS) built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project is designed as a placement-ready academic project, focusing on clean UI, dynamic content loading, and scalable structure without using any backend.

## 🚀 Overview

This project is designed to showcase my skills in responsive web design, interactivity using JavaScript/React, and deployment using Netlify. Whether it's a personal portfolio, mini-tool, or full-stack app, this serves as a demonstration of clean UI and practical features.
